   · Specifically, I installed Yosemite on laptop Lenovo P, but I do not have internet. Wi-Fi not at all,, so I hooked up DSL cable from the router to a laptop. Also I got another cable from router to the PC. I see that's Ethernet connected, plugged cabble, all ok. but when I try to 'surf', Safari does not load my page at  Interaction Count: 2. I bought a BCMNG card for my Hackintosh, but I haven't been able to get Wifi, Airdrop, or Handoff/Continuity working on it. Bluetooth works fine, and I swear WiFi did, but I guess it wasn't (I use Ethernet mainly). I have logged out and back into my iCloud account on the Mac and my main iPhone, so I'm going to wait a few days like some have suggested for Handoff.  · My Hackintosh Details: Iam curious about using mac on my old windows pc. Posted January 8, First when i enabled broadcom wifi and bluetooth from customize section all of sudden wifi got up and detected networks but i reinstalled the os now it is not working am confused that what is the mistake iam doing while installing this is the 40th.
